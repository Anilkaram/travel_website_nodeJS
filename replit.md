# TravelEase Travel Booking Platform

## Overview

TravelEase is a web application that allows users to search, explore, and book travel accommodations online. The application is built with a React frontend and Express backend, using Drizzle ORM for database operations with a PostgreSQL database. The UI is built using ShadCN UI components (based on Radix UI primitives) with Tailwind CSS for styling.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## User Preferences

- Maintain a clean, modern UI design that follows the existing aesthetic
- Ensure mobile responsiveness for all features
- Prioritize performance and loading speed
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Follow the existing project structure
- Implement features incrementally and test thoroughly

## System Architecture

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight alternative to React Router)
- **State Management**: React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with ShadCN UI components
- **Build Tool**: Vite

The frontend is organized into pages and components with a shared UI component library based on ShadCN UI. The application uses a light/dark theme system and follows a responsive design approach.

### Backend

- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **API**: RESTful endpoints under the `/api` route prefix
- **Database Access**: Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: (To be implemented - likely session-based)

The backend serves both the API endpoints and the static frontend assets in production. In development, Vite handles the frontend assets with hot module reloading.

### Database

- **Type**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM
- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- **Connection**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL

The database schema includes tables for users, destinations, hotels, contact forms, and bookings.

## Key Components

### Shared Components

- **Schema**: Defined in `shared/schema.ts`, contains database table definitions and Zod validation schemas
- **Utils**: Common utility functions in `client/src/lib/utils.ts`

### Frontend Components

- **Pages**: Main application views (Home, Destination, Hotel, Search)
- **UI Components**: Reusable UI elements following ShadCN UI patterns
- **Layout Components**: Header, Footer, and page structure components
- **Feature Components**: Specialized components for specific features (booking forms, search interfaces, etc.)

### Backend Components

- **Routes**: API endpoint definitions
- **Storage**: Data access layer for database operations
- **Middleware**: Request processing, logging, error handling

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: User interacts with the React frontend
2. **API Requests**: Frontend makes requests to the backend API using React Query
3. **Data Processing**: Backend processes requests, interacts with the database through Drizzle ORM
4. **Response**: Backend responds with JSON data
5. **UI Updates**: Frontend updates based on received data

Most data fetching is handled through React Query, which provides caching, refetching, and loading state management.

## External Dependencies

### Frontend
- React and React DOM
- Wouter for routing
- Tanstack React Query for data fetching
- ShadCN UI components (based on Radix UI)
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- React Hook Form for form handling
- Zod for validation
- DayJS for date manipulation

### Backend
- Express for the server
- Drizzle ORM for database operations
- Neon Database SDK for PostgreSQL connectivity
- Connect-PG-Simple for session management (if implemented)

## Deployment Strategy

The application is configured to run both in development and production environments:

### Development
- Frontend: Vite dev server with hot module reloading
- Backend: Express server with request logging
- Database: PostgreSQL on Replit

### Production
- Build: Vite builds the frontend assets, esbuild bundles the server
- Serve: Express serves both the API and static frontend assets
- Database: Stays connected to the same PostgreSQL instance

The application is configured to be deployed on Replit with autoscale enabled.

## Database Schema

- **Users**: Contains user account information (id, username, password, email, fullName)
- **Destinations**: Travel destinations (id, name, country, description, imagePath, propertyCount, rating, isPopular)
- **Hotels**: Accommodation options (id, name, destinationId, description, address, imagePath, rating, pricePerNight, facilities, isFeatured)
- **Bookings**: Track user bookings (id, userId, hotelId, checkIn, checkOut, guests, totalPrice, status)
- **ContactForm**: Store user contact form submissions (id, name, email, message, createdAt)

## Implementation Roadmap

1. **Database Setup**
   - Ensure PostgreSQL is provisioned
   - Run schema migrations

2. **Backend Development**
   - Implement remaining API endpoints
   - Add authentication and session management
   - Implement error handling and validation

3. **Frontend Development**
   - Complete any unfinished pages
   - Implement authentication UI
   - Add user profiles and booking management
   - Enhance search functionality

4. **Testing & Optimization**
   - Test all features thoroughly
   - Optimize performance
   - Ensure mobile responsiveness

5. **Deployment**
   - Configure production environment
   - Deploy application

## Next Steps

1. Set up the PostgreSQL database and configure the connection
2. Complete the backend API endpoints
3. Implement authentication
4. Complete the frontend pages and features
5. Test the application thoroughly
